My python solutions to Advent of Code 2020

## What is Advent of code?
[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an advent calendar with new small programming puzzles each day. Created by Eric Wastl.

## My stars
Each day can grant you 2 stars if both puzzles are solved. (And also some points if you're the first to solve it, but I like my sleep, so I will not be getting up at 6 am to be among the first 100 solvers.)
